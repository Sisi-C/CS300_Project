# CS300_Project

Question 1: What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Answer: The problem we addressed in this project was efficiently managing and organizing course information for the Computer Science department at ABCU. We created a program to load data and implemented a binary tree data structure to handle the course information effectively.

Question 2: How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Answer: To solve the problem, we first understood the project requirements and the department's needs. We created a program to load data and constructed a binary tree data structure to organize courses. Data structures are important because they determine how data is stored and accessed. The binary tree helped us manage courses hierarchically, aiding in quick and efficient data retrieval. Every data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages. We need to carefully consider the specific needs of our program to choose the correct data structure.

Question 3: How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Answer: While working on the project, we encountered difficulties in making the binary tree work faster when getting data. To handle this, we looked up information, asked teachers for help, and tried different things multiple times. Eventually, all these attempts paid off, and we figured out a way to make it work more efficiently.

Question 4: How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Answer : This project expanded my software design approach by emphasizing the importance of efficient data structures. I learned to consider scalability and efficiency when choosing data structures. This knowledge now guides me in selecting appropriate structures for handling larger datasets.

Question 5 : How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Answer : Working on this project has evolved the way I write programs. I now focus on making code maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I use clear variable names, proper comments, and modular design to ensure easy understanding and modification. This approach enhances collaboration and reduces errors when making changes to the program.
